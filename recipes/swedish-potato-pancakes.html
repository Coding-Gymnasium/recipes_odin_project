  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Some of the tastiest potato recipes originate from Europe (sorry North
    America).
  </p>

  <p>
    Similar to Irish potato bread, this fluffy pancake is made with a
    potato-based batter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Poured into a pan and fried until golden brown, it’s a quick and satisfying
    breakfast or brunch.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Potatoes x 1.5 lbs</li>
    <li>Flour x 1 cup</li>
    <li>Baking Powder x 1 tsp</li>
    <li>Salt x 1 tsp</li>
    <li>Pepper x 1/4 tsp</li>
    <li>Milk x 1.5 cups</li>
    <li>Onions x 3 tbsp grated</li>
    <li>Eggs x 2</li>
    <li>Sour Cream, garnish</li>
    <li>Chive, garnish</li>
    <li>Lingonberry Jam, garnish</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Peel, rinse and grate the raw potatoes into a bowl of very cold water. (If
      you're starting this the night before, cover bowl and refrigerate potatoes
      in the water til morning.).
    </li>
    <li>
      Drain potato shreds in a wire mesh strainer or colander and using your
      hands, press as much moisture out as possible. Cover with a paper towel
      and set aside.
    </li>

    <li>
      Whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, pepper and one cup of the milk
      to make a smooth batter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the grated onion, eggs and remaining milk, if needed to make a
      slightly thin batter. Whisk until combined.
    </li>
    <li>Stir the potato shreds into the batter.</li>

    <li>
      Heat griddle or large frying pan to about 350°F and rub the griddle with a
      thin coat of canola oil (I use a paper towel to do this & you may need to
      reapply between each batch).
    </li>
    <li>
      When oil is hot, pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the griddle and cook
      until golden on the bottom. Flip pancake over and cook until golden on
      that side.
    </li>
    <li>Serve with sour cream & chives or lingonberry jam.</li>
  </ol>
